# Godot Game
## What is this?
At my former high school, during our senior year, we are tasked with working on a "Senior Research Project." All students work on their peojects for about 7 months before some are chosen to present their projects at the local Science Fair. This game was
my Senior Research Project! I chose to make a 3D Open-World Video Game using the Godot Engine.

### Research Report
Since I had to write a formal report on this project for the Science Fair, I have attached a [copy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qydWWS78pXLuZ28XSa_MsRqUY571nXC0JWwho4BeVkU/edit?usp=sharing) of the final paper.

### Pictures
A video demo of the game being played can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KV_Ze2EO4qbC6jEO2Qg7CJ69jbAlFaQF?usp=drive_link).

## Where is the game??
While I'm reluctant to share the source code for my game online, an executable for my game is available [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KV_Ze2EO4qbC6jEO2Qg7CJ69jbAlFaQF?usp=drive_link) (the files are too big for GitHub). Simply download the zip file
and the [testgame.save](testgame.save) file in this repository, extract the two zipped files, put them all in the same directory, and run the executable.

### Playing the game
Use the WASD keys to move around. To access the quest menu/quit the game, hit escape. To open the inventory, press tab. Of course, with more development, I would integrate these instructions into the tutorial of the game.

### Fun bugs
* Try jumping on the NPCs heads to make them fall over!
* For extra fun, try talking to them after they topple over and watch them spin around!
* There is specific route of dialogue options that will hypothetically take you on a different gameplay "path" in the plot... But right now it just makes the game crash. Can you find it?
* Go to the beach and watch the grass go in the water!
* Find a hill and watch the grass disappear beneath your feet!

## Graphics
Most graphics were NOT made by me. I owe a lot of thanks to free open-source assets repositories, created by some really cool people including [**Kenney**](https://kenney.nl/ "@embed") and [**Quaternius**](https://quaternius.com/index.html "@embed").

## Audio
As for sound effects, I used a wider array of sources, but some predominant ones include [**Mixkit**](https://mixkit.co/ "@embed"), [**Bluezone**](https://www.bluezone-corporation.com/ "@embed"), and [**Sonniss**](https://sonniss.com/ "@embed"). Sonniss in
particular stood out to me, because every year they release a pretty large collection of completely free, no-attribution audio clips specifically in celebration of the Game Developers' Conference ([https://sonniss.com/gameaudiogdc](url)).

I made the music using Chrome's Music Lab--specifically, the [Song Maker project](https://musiclab.chromeexperiments.com/Song-Maker/ "@embed"). Rudimentary, I know.
